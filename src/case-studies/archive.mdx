# Slide hoarder
I was at a garage sale in rural Washington state in 2015. It was an estate sale that the family had hired a company to oversee the sale. Within the sale I found a Kodak branded box and excitedly looked inside expecting expired 35mm film. What I instead found were slides of family photos.   

I felt a little morbid. "Why are these being sold?" I didn't grow up in a structured family environment, and so family photos from my childhood are scarce. Why would these be thrown out?

## 5 dollars
Collectively all slides were bargained down to 10$ at the lowest. I only had 5$ in cash and so I parted with half of them. I couldn't view them in depth but quickly found them to be photos from Japan at a glance. I asked the employees what they knew of the family, most knew nothing because it was not their job and outside their payscale to care. "It was a Navy family" the oldest employee told me. "Husband was stationed out in japan, met a woman and they settled out here." I had bothered enough employees and called it a day, excited to scan the slides to view them in high fidelity.

## When is this?   

The photos are stunning. Exposed perfectly and only slightly damaged over the years.   
I felt creepy viewing them, family dinners, beach days, festivals. All of these memories of a family I've never met. I began to regret not running to an ATM and coming back with more cash to purchase the rest of the slides. That of these memories I recovered I only could archive half.
The photos depict a developing japan, in a decade I can't pinpoint. Through viewing the 100+ slides I came to the assumption that the wife's was related to family that owned a camera shop, leading me to believe this was the source of the high technical skill.
