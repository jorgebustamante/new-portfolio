# Coming Soon
<!-- 
# Overview   
Small business owners need creative guides in their native language and that are concise and simplify the ease of maintaining their digital presence.

# Problems   
- Instructional media is often confusing
- Videos are hard for an older audience
- PDFs are inaccessible often times for technical literacy issues
- Emailing them their guide can be easy to lose and hard to access
- Website guides are not useful because a SMB owner would still need to find exactly what they need for a variety of situations.

**How might one empower users with a curated list of everything they need to maintain their digital presence?**

# Research 
## Target Audience

- Small business owners
- People new to maintaining a digital presence
- People with low digital literacy
- People with access to less computers
- People who can't afford high budget digital web or marketing solutions

# Design Approach   
First one needs to revisit the root of the problem, small business owners with less capital are attempting to compete digitally with business owners who have more capital to invest in digital solutions. With this in mind our main users are people who utilize an array of free and paid services such as *Shopify, Wordpress, Squarespace, Wix, Instagram, Facebook, Yelp, and Google My Business.*   
With this in mind, I started mapping out categories of what needs to be documented for these users. Dividing each category with subjects such as *Content Management Systems, E-Commerce, Marketing, and Business Information.*

# Solution   
Component based print guide, physical print media constructed to order for each SMB owners unique situation

# Learnings   
- Print media guidelines
- Creating a component library
- Inclusive and non threatening branding and technical writing -->
