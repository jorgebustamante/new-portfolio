# Overview
 
Volumen Digital acquired a contract with a floral boutique that previously only did events and conferences for floral arrangements finds itself struggling in the quarantine economy and needs to adapt their business to retail based sales and needs an online platform to enable that within LA county.   
My roles in this involved UX Design, and Web Development.
 
# Problems  
 
- Business has not done retail sales before
- Business does not have a formal inventory
- Business needs to do local delivery
- Business needs to reach their target audience  
 
**How might one start a retail business model from scratch?**
 
# Research  
 
## Target Audience
- Couples age 25-45, 75% male, 25% female
- Funeral planners age 30+, 50% male 50% female
- Wedding and party planners age 20+, 90% female
Given this target audience, one can see it's very age diverse and spans across users who are both seeking arrangements for personal uses as well as commercial uses.
 
## Business Strengths  
- Good designs,
- Broad history of good work and many positive testimonials
- A lot of supporting evidence of work on social media   
 
 
# Previous Product

## Performance  
 
The prior product was a Wix site template. The first pain point noticed is the massive load times. Running a Lighthouse test on the prior product illustrated to me that continuing with Wix wouldn't be acceptable. Where many of these site builders come with convenience of being able to do oneself, they also come with mass amounts of overhead that their service starts to deteriorate as a self built site scales in complexity and media.

## Old Design   

The previous product featured a traditional floral bouquet color palette, classical serif fonts such as Times New Roman and Cursive, and a lot of media featuring the clients services. Their work with arrangements has largely been successful but their existing web presence was dating rapidly and needed a more modern look to match their modern service.  
While Wix was a convenient choice at the time, the clients web presence should always serve to complement their service, not poke holes in it.

# Design Approach  

Their previous website was looking dated and was from Wix and had loading issues. I tried a couple different directions to bring their new site towards, but thought it best to stick with the *elegant* brand personality they display on social media and through their work.  
While the client's goals is to make revenue in retail floral arrangement sales, their work on events is their biggest focus and I didn't want to neglect that from the hierarchy in their digital presence. While events in LA county are far and few for the duration of the pandemic, one wouldn't want another web redesign post quarantine.  
## Wireframes
I attempted a couple different style approaches, one elegant and inline with the client's previous branding, the other being more avant garde and *punchy*. The more elegant approach was chosen for being more in line with their work history, but also it seemed more successful to highlight the product with minimum colors on the surrounding website architecture, and that the website should not overpower the visuals of the products.

## Site Mapping  
 
Site mapping for this was a mostly straight forward process and initially was not very different from the average E-commerce approach for a small business. The exception being the featuring of events within the product. Retail sales are an immediate goal for the business, but the long term goal is sustaining their history of doing floral arrangements for events. Keeping this in mind and allowing users to fill out quote forms for each event type was unique to this project. I chose to go with individual event pages rather than a single page displaying all of the event work they can do, this was a successful approach to avoid cluttering a page with too much media that didn't share enough synchronicity.

# Solution  
The client was favorable of Shopify as their E-Commerce approach based on good experiences they had read online from peers, I personally supported this as Shopify's app ecosystem is well populated and Shopify as a platform provides many resources for shop owners. It additionally is the lingua franca in E-commerce, so should they need work in the future one wouldn't have to look far.

## Colors  
 
I used a limited color palette that the client previously featured on their business card based on a signature bouquet they created. Their previous website was highly saturated with colors and media content, I saw it best to go with a minimalist approach with plenty of white space and use of low saturated pastel colors for accents. The floral arrangements are the star of the show, and one shouldn't let the website architecture outshine that.

## Typeface
I chose Cooper Black as the brand display typeface. Thick, funky, 70s style serif fonts certainly made a strong comeback in the last few years. The early 2010s was dominated by sans serif and minimalist typefaces(i.e. American Apparel), and once a design trend peaks in oversaturation it leads greatly to [Perceptual Blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_blindness) as users become numb to its over familiar stimuli.  
The simple and utilitarian look has run its course, brands now need to display a more expressive and human like connections to users. Cooper Black was additionally a leading typeface in advertising in the 1960s-1980s, given our age diverse target audience I saw this opportunity to cast a wide net with brand personality and utilize the nostalgia associated with this font for older users.

## Flow
The flow within the app is different from traditional E-Commerce. Traditionally within an online store one can buy something and get it shipped to them, in stakeholder meetings it was determined that local Los Angeles based delivery or in-store pickup was the best solution for the client. Users for the boutique also get featured prompts to upsell certain products, such as Teddy bears, balloons, and handwritten cards.

# Learnings 
## .liquid Blues
The liquid templating engine shopify uses is reminiscent of Nunjucks.js and Handlebars.js. While I personally had coded in templating engines in school, I quickly met limitations within the engine. In React.js components are very reusable.  
In shopify, their Section object is not inherently reusable because it hardcodes setting values to the Section. Meaning any media/text one would apply to a Section will hardcode it to said section and not allow it to dynamically display different data across the site. This leads to a lot of redundancy in the code base and duplication of code.  
While I still feel Shopify is the best E-commerce solution for small businesses, I can see how this scales poorly for more complex E-commerce projects.  
## Visual Media and Empathy
Supporting media is hard. Small businesses often don't have the money to hire product photographers, especially so within the 2020 economy. In the case of floral arrangements, even crafting the model for product photos entails losing product.
Even for promotional photos, the business had never prior employed professional photography of their craft. It was certainly a challenge having to express to stakeholders why it was a bad idea to feature photos of impressive floral craft simply because the fidelity of the photo wasn't acceptable.  
Educating stakeholders on user empathy was a new experience, I found myself teaching a high level view of user empathy with the question: *"Why would a user buy something that is represented in a blurry photo?"*  
It certainly is uncomfortable expressing to stakeholders that much of the media isn't high quality enough to use, but I'm not in business to take money from people for half baked products. A small business investing in a website is a big investment, I want them to get their money's worth.
## Hierarchy  
Within the design process, hierarchy was consistently the biggest struggle. The business needs retail sales as soon as possible, at the same time however-- events are the breadwinner for income. Finding a balance within this was challenging, but ultimately rewarding seeing a successful outcome that didn't neglect any aspect of their business.
