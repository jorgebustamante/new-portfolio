# Overview   
Small business owners come from economically disadvantaged economic backgrounds, often don’t have generational wealth. Many come from non technical backgrounds and their businesses are lagging behind in the past as they fail to adapt to digital presence and the online economy. Covid-19 has amplified the economic despair of these business owners. Volumen Digital seeks to provide curated resources and guides in adapting their business and increasing their digital presence.

# Problems   
- These business owners often don’t have high technical literacy
- Small Business owners often don’t have the funds to pay for a company to take on these issues
- Small Business owners are often unaware of the benefits of maintaining a digital presence

**How might we empower these business owners effectively and help them improve their digital presence?**


# Research 
## Target Audience  
- Small business owners, 30-50 years old, multicultural

# Design Process   

## Hierarchy   
Within the hierarchy for the landing page, a big focus was on story telling and having captivating content without making users feel this space didn't belong to them. I analyzed a lot of SAAS approaches to landing page hierarchy but this was a unique problem that couldn't have a cookie cutter solution.   
Due to stakeholder constraints, the information within the landing page is not static forever and is subject to change as far as what's promoted, the text and media content. For this reason I broke the landing page up into numerous different rows of what type of information each row could potentially carry in the future and based the hierarchy off of this.

## Making an Inclusive Brand   

The utmost importance expressed in stakeholder meetings was to have as inclusive of a brand personality as possible. Many resources online available to businesses are excessively high jargon, overly professional in appearance, and feel unrelatable to many small business owners.   
I chose to go with a more colorful approach in the landing page, something to express a more casual and human like environment. For supporting media, I invested heavily in utilizing graphics from Pablo Stanley's illustration libraries; Open Doodles and Open Peeps.   
Pablo's work in these open source illustration libraries are rounded, expressive, and a modern take on Chibi styles. I saw these as a great opportunity to use for supporting media both for their visual value, but also because of the increased ease of access for stakeholders to create additional supporting media for content within the campaign.

## Article Design
The CMS for creating content on the site had to be as accessible as possible to stakeholders. For that reason the text editor is essentially a rich text editor that can make edits to font weight and add inline images. 
Within those limitations I designed an article like approach inspired by Indianapolis Monthly. I examined leaders in onlne publications such as NyTimes, Medium, Vox, and thought carefully about what would be the best design approach within the campaign. 
I chose an approach of rounded media that is not overly dominating and alternately floats different directions within the article content.

# Development Process   
## Performance
User retention is important, and design aside Volumen Digital needed a high performance and seamless web presence. I went with Gatsby.js, both for Gatsby's high performance and fast load times as a static site generator, but also becuase of Gatsby's use of supporting React natively and ensuring that finding developers in the future to be as easy as possible. 
Gatsby allows for features such as progressive media loading, Preloading pages with Gatsby's Link API allowing for seamless site navigation, and built in image optimization through the Image Sharp library.   
## CSS   
I chose TailwindCSS for the CSS framework. Tailwind offers a CSS framework of utility based CSS classes with easy to understand classnames. This choice was largely done because unlike CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, Material-- Tailwind does not have CSS shortcuts for visual components such as Cards, Columns or Rows. This allows for a CSS experience that does not involve learning actual architecture of CSS classes within frameworks, and Tailwind focuses more on inline styles to have heavily localized styling. Tailwind is lower level styling than other frameworks and rather than expecting a developer to being proficient at Tailwind, one only needs to be proficient in CSS to make full use of Tailwind.
Tailwind additionally pairs well with it's built in purge tool, and libraries like PurgeCSS. Stripping unused styles from the bundle and making the client side browser only download what's used, rather than a whole CSS library.
## CMS and Hosting   
Seeing how involved stakeholders intend to be within the longevity of the campaign, one expects frequent content updates. While I view Contentful CMS as the best option for accessible CMS editors, I chose to take the approach of building a custom Netlify CMS editor with live preview. This localizes the technical investments more to one platform, in that stakeholders may view deploy logs, analytics, and create content all on one web platform.
Netlify CMS acts differently than most CMSs, in that rather than Netlify's CMS hosting a database of CMS content, it instead commits CMS generated content to the git repository of the web app as markdown content, Netlify's continuous deployment then rebuilds the static site on new commits to the git repo. 
Netlify CMS involved a lot more code labor than other CMS solutions, but I see this decision as the best approach to give stakeholders as much accessibility within the product as possible.

# Solution   

The solution is an article based platform that provides resources and platform for community outreach within the LA county area. Featuring nclusive branding and accessible jargon to help small business owners and other community members feel they belong and can adapt their brands. Scaling with site sections such as community directories, interactive maps serving target areas, and resources for outreach.    
Big picture to stay connected with user problems, we implement a series of surveys as well to check in frequently with users to always keep in mind of what pain points are developing in a highly volatile economy.

# Learnings   
This project was fun working on and included the biggest team I've worked with yet. I think the most unique thing I had to tackle in this was creating a brand personality that was inclusive. I often found myself back tracking and adjusting font pairings and supporting media to better suit a theme of inclusivity.   
Making designs for articles is tough, the biggest issue is being aware of technical constraints and how as far as articles go, it is unstructured markdown content with images coming from a CMS and I can't control general formatting very well. It lead to me having to get creative with CSS properties such as nth-child for floating images alternate directions. Getting general margins looking nice within articles was an additional challenge and made me greatly appreciate those who work in print media.   
This was my first time using illustration libraries and it was really a blast, the added value that illustrations provide is great, but the level of control that designers have in creating them and making these illustrative components work with the brand, it's a highly valuable tool and I'm enthusiastic for illustration libraries to be a bigger role in content creation in the future.
